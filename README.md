# Firebase Authentication Android Template

This is a starter template for a native Android application built with Java that demonstrates a complete, secure user authentication flow using Google's Firebase platform. It includes user sign-up, login, and a "gatekeeper" activity that protects routes from unauthenticated users.

This project was built to serve as a solid foundation for any Android app that requires user accounts.

***

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Sign-Up:** New users can create an account using their email and password.
* **User Login:** Existing users can securely log in to their accounts.
* **Firestore Integration:** Upon registration, user details (like name and phone) are saved to a corresponding document in the Cloud Firestore database.
* **Protected Routes:** A "gatekeeper" `MainActivity` checks the user's login status on app startup and directs them to either the `HomeActivity` (if logged in) or the `LoginActivity` (if not).
* **Clean UI:** Simple, clean, and functional XML layouts for all screens.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your own machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Android Studio (latest version recommended)
* A Google Account to use Firebase

### Installation & Firebase Configuration

This project **will not run** out of the box until you connect it to your own Firebase project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AuthenticationwithFireBase.git](https://github.com/your-username/AuthenticationwithFireBase.git)
    ```

2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Open Android Studio and choose "Open an existing project."
    * Navigate to the cloned folder and open it.

3.  **Create your Firebase Project:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Click **"Add project"** and give your project a name.

4.  **Connect the App to Firebase:**
    * Inside your new Firebase project, click the Android icon to **"Add an app"**.
    * **Android package name:** You must use the package name from this project. You can find it in your `app/build.gradle.kts` file, inside the `defaultConfig` block (e.g., `com.example.gidanbeachresorts`). Enter this exact name in the Firebase setup.
    * **Download `google-services.json`:** Firebase will prompt you to download a `google-services.json` configuration file.
    * **Add the file to your project:** In Android Studio, switch to the **Project** view (from the default **Android** view) and drag the downloaded `google-services.json` file into the `app/` directory. This is a critical step.

5.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    * In the Firebase Console, go to the **Authentication** section.
    * Click the "Sign-in method" tab and **enable** the **Email/Password** provider.
    * Next, go to the **Firestore Database** section.
    * Click **"Create database"**, start in **production mode**, and choose a location.
    * Go to the **Rules** tab in Firestore and paste in the following rules to allow users to sign up and read content:
        ```rules
        rules_version = '2';

        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allows a user to create and update their own profile
            match /Users/{userId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    * Click **Publish**.

6.  **Run the App:**
    * Clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio.
    * Run the app on an emulator or a physical device. It should now be fully connected to your Firebase backend.
